### Library Management System

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a Python application that simulates a simple real-world library management system scenario involving the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) techniques and principles such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction and polymorphism  in terms of managing a collection of library members and books via enabling the basic functionalities such as:
- Add books / new members
- Remove books / existent members
- Borrow books
- Return books
- List available books
- List borrowed books.
Documentation is included to ensure clarity as well as Testing for usability and maintainability.

## The System Features
Book Management Feature: Add and remove books from the library system.
Member Management Feature: Add and remove members from the the library system.
Borrowing/Returning Books Features: Enable the library members to borrow and return books.
Books' Availability Checking Feature: List all exsistant and borrowed books with borrower's information.
Library User' Types: Differentiate between members types as student and teacher.

## Classes and Methods
# Library
The Library class manages a collection of books and members.

Methods:
add_book(book): Adds a book to the library's collection.
remove_book(book): Removes a book from the collection.
add_member(member): Registers a new member.
remove_member(member): Removes an existing member.
borrow_book(book, member): Allows a member to borrow a book if it is available.
return_book(book, member): Allows a member to return a borrowed book.
list_available_books(): Lists all books that are currently available.
list_borrowed_books(): Lists all books currently borrowed, along with borrower details.

# Book
The Book class represents each book in the library.

Attributes:
title (str): Title of the book.
author (str): Author of the book.
is_borrowed (bool): Tracks if the book is currently borrowed.

# Member 
The Member class represents a library member with basic details.

Attributes:
name (str): Name of the member.
borrowed_books (list): List of books currently borrowed by the member.
StudentMember and TeacherMember
StudentMember and TeacherMember are subclasses of Member.
StudentMember: May have additional borrowing restrictions.
TeacherMember: Might have extended borrowing privileges.

## Setup Instructions:
Python version or packages required.
Instructions to install dependencies listed in requirements.txt (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage Examples:
Examples such as adding books, borrowing books, etc usage.
Classes and Methods:
Explain each class and method with its purpose and parameters.

## Detailed Problem-Solving Processse


## Testing

Learning Outcomes
By completing this assessment, you will be able to:
- Evaluate Object-Oriented Programming techniques, associated tools, and Application Program Interfaces.
- Analyze and document a complex task utilizing a range of problem-solving skills.

- ### Functionality
    - The Library class should manage a collection of books and members.
    - Implement methods to:
        - Add and remove books from the library.
        - Add and remove members from the library.
        - Borrow and return books.
        - List available books.
        - List borrowed books and their borrowers.
- ### Documentation and Analysis:
    - Document the problem-solving process, including:
        - Initial problem analysis.
        - Design decisions and rationale.
        - Challenges faced and solutions implemented.
        - Example usage of the classes and methods.
    - Use docstrings to document the classes and methods.
    - Include test cases to demonstrate the functionality of your code.
- ### Project Structure
Here is a suggested project structure for your library management system:
```

├── library_management/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── library.py
│   ├── book.py
│   ├── member.py
│   └── test_library.py

└── requirements.txt
```
- ### Detailed Instructions
    #### Step 1: Create the Git Repository
        - Create a new repository on GitHub named library_management_system.
        - Clone the repository to your local machine.
        - Set up a basic directory structure as shown above.
    #### Step 2: Implement the Classes and Methods
        - Library Class (library.py)
        - Book Class (book.py)
        - Member Class and Subclasses (member.py)
        - Test Cases (test_library.py)
    #### Step 3: Documentation and Analysis
        1. README.md:
            - Provide an overview of the project.
            - Include setup instructions and usage examples.
            - Document the classes, methods, and their functionality.
            #### Classes and Methods
